# Chess
(Development of my own Chess game)
As a coder, this is my first big project in C#. The game is complete, only missing online multiplayer, and dead position detection.
I expect there to be many things in my code that may be redundant, wrong, or extremely inefficient due to my mediocre knowledge of the language. 
At this stage I believe my Chess game to be complete, so I will only push an update if I decide to add one or both of the previously mentioned concepts.
