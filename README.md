As a coder, this is my first big project in C#. The game is complete, only missing a few components.
I expect there to be many things in my code that may be redundant, wrong, or extremely inefficient due to my relatively average experience with the language. 
This game visually resembles https://www.chess.com/ since that was my inspiration, but no code was copied and is original.
