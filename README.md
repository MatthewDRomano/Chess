# Chess
(Development of my own Chess game)
As a coder, this is my first big project in C#. The game is complete for the most part, only missing a few features such as draws and an implemented Chess AI. 
I expect there to be many things in my code that may be redundant, wrong, or extremely inefficient due to my mediocre knowledge of the language. 
I will continue to push updates on this project until I  believe it to be complete.
